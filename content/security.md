Unstatic Labs takes security seriously. This page describes our security practices and how to report vulnerabilities.

## Our Security Practices

### Infrastructure

- **Hosting**: We use reputable cloud providers with strong security track records
- **TLS/HTTPS**: All connections are encrypted using modern TLS
- **Access controls**: Role-based access with principle of least privilege
- **Monitoring**: We monitor our systems for suspicious activity

### Development

- **Code review**: Code changes are reviewed before deployment
- **Dependency management**: We track and update dependencies regularly
- **Secrets management**: Credentials are stored securely, never in code
- **Testing**: We test for common vulnerabilities

### Data Protection

- **Encryption**: Data at rest and in transit is encrypted
- **Backups**: Regular backups with secure storage
- **Access logging**: Access to sensitive data is logged
- **Data minimization**: We collect only what we need
