## How Ventures Work

Most ventures start as solutions to client problems. When there's broader market potential, we spin them off as joint ventures with co-investment from both parties.

Each venture is designed to become an independent company with its own:
- Legal entity
- Banking and payment processing
- Operations and compliance

This isolates risk and allows each venture to build relationships appropriate to its specific market.
