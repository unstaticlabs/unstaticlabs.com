We operate on a hybrid model: where **IT Consulting** meets **Venture Incubation**.

We turn our clients' problems into businesses that we co-own and co-build together.

## The Model

### Traditional consulting

You pay → they deliver → they leave. Their incentive is billable hours, not your success.

### Our approach

You come with a real-world business problem that we value → **We work together to co-design a solution** with the ambition to turn it into a product: you bring the domain knowledge, we bring the product skills.

You pay for a MVS: a **Minimum Viable Solution** to your problem → We build it . **But we do not stop there** . → With the help of the MVS, we validate the market opportunity → If there's a market, we create a company together.

We co-invest, you co-invest. Our interests are fully aligned.

Our business model is to incubate startups that solve real problems.
Not billable hours.

## The Process: THINK → BELIEVE → BUILD → ITERATE

### 1. You come to us with a business problem

You have a business challenge that needs a digital solution. We begin on a consulting basis. Applying proven Design Thinking techniques, we co-design a solution to your needs. But we do not just design a patch. At this stage, the ambition is already to create a successful product.

In this first phase, our team of experienced product strategists, designers and engineers will support you with frameworks and direct contributions to:

- Gather and organize your data into a system full of insights,
- Discover your problem space, articulating clear problem statements,
- Ideate solutions to your prioritized problem statements,
- Review and prioritize your solution ideas into a clean product strategy,
- Deliver a comprehensive technical analysis and architecture proposal,
- Deliver a powerful compelling product pitch: problem, solution, go to market.

After this point, we both make a decision to keep going: if we believe the market opportunity is real and addressable, then we will offer to invest in your solution.

### 2. We build a solution, together

We don't just solve *your* problem.
We ship solutions that solve it for an entire market.

This is where we truly differ from traditional consulting firms: We are a venture studio.
Instead of *paying* for billable hours, You're *funding* the incubation of a startup you own.

This second phase is the most difficult, as we're going from 0 to 1. It's ignition time.
There is really only one thing that matters now: to Believe.

We'll scope and deliver a Minimum Viable Solution.
For this, we will put together the best team with founders from both sides.
We will leverage our platforms, our ecosystem of technologies and infrastructure, in order to dedicate our time and energy to speed.

Believe in a problem worth solving.
And that we are the best to solve it.

### 3. BUILD → MEASURE → LEARN

From this stage, our goal is to perform the **BUILD → MEASURE → LEARN** loop as quickly as we can. Unstatic Labs is incubating the project.

As we build, we test market fit. Is this problem widespread? Is the solution valuable to others? Can this become a profitable business?

### 4. A new venture takes off

When we identify satisfying product-market fit:

- **New legal entity** — separate from Unstatic Labs
- **Shared ownership** — you and us, co-invested
- **Aligned incentives** — we both succeed or fail together
- **Your problem solved** — plus equity in a company solving it for everyone

## Why This Works

### For you

- **Solve your problem** — immediate value from the consulting engagement
- **Upside potential** — if it becomes a company, you're a co-owner
- **Lower risk** — we share the investment in scaling
- **Expert execution** — we specialize in building and spinning up digital products

### For us

- **Aligned incentives** — we're invested in your success
- **Quality deal flow** — real problems from real businesses
- **Shared risk** — we co-invest alongside you
- **Long-term relationships** — partners, not just clients

## What We're Good At

- **Digital products** — web apps, SaaS, platforms, marketplaces
- **Product-market fit** — validating whether something should be a business
- **Company formation** — legal structure, operations, compliance
- **Scaling** — taking a prototype to a real company

## Not Every Project Becomes a Company

Most consulting engagements stay consulting engagements.
We deliver a solution, you pay for it, done.

The venture model kicks in when:

- The problem is widespread (not unique to you)
- The solution has market potential
- Both parties want to pursue it

We're selective. Not every good solution is a good business.
